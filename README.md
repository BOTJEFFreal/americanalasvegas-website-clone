## Description

In this tech task, I expertly cloned the website https://americanalasvegas.com/ using React. Leveraging my skills in front-end development, I recreated its design, layout, and functionality while ensuring a seamless user experience. Employing React's components and state management, I successfully replicated the site's features, demonstrating proficiency in web development.


For this tech task, I skillfully integrated the OpenMap API to introduce interactive map functionality to the website. To visualize my progress, I've attached snapshots of the website during its initial development in the WebPageImage folder.
